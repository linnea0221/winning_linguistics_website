      <div class="col"> Ellie is the best linguist. In 1998 when she was born she didn't realise she would be destined to life as a linguist. However, one day in college she got hooked on grammar and has been studying it ever since. If you ever want to contact her and discuss syntax or langauge aquisition you should drop her an email! Admittedly, she doesn't know loads but that doesn't mean she isn't willing to try! Other things Ellie loves is British Sign Langauge, crochet, and pumpkins. She lives with her amazing friend and housemate, Linnâ€Œ&#xE9;a. <a href="https://eleanorcook.github.io/elliecook/">You've discovered the secret link to Ellie's page!</a></div>
      <div class="col"> Linn&#233;a was also born in 1998 and didn't know that she was destined to life as a linguist either. However, she had the opportunity to learn a bunch of languages, and to the disdain of linguists trying to escape stereotypes everywhere, she joined their ranks. You're welcome to contact her to discuss semantics or language acquisition by dropping her an email. She may not know much, but she sure does love sharing ideas with people. Linn&#233;a also enjoys circus, knitting, and ships. She lives with her amazing friend and housemate, Ellie. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linn%C3%A9a-bj%C3%B6rk-belmonte-9845a013a/">You've discovered the secret link to Linn&#233;a's Linkedin page!</a></div>
